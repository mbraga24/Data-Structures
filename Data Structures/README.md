# Data Structures

## Linked Lists

**Big O Notation**

**Constant Time O(1)**
- Adding/Removing head nodes
- Adding/Removing tail nodes

**Linear Time O(n)**
- Searching through Linked List

**More Details**

tHe Memory Management aspect of a Linked List is that memory doesn't have to be stored together. Linked Lists are very effective at using space or memory efficiently. Each piece of data is stored on it's own and each piece of data has a next pointer that references the location of the next piece of data. All the data still connected it's just not stored all in one place.

## Binary Search

**Big O Notation**

**Logarithmic Runtime (or Time Complexicity) O(log n)**
- Adding/Removing data
- Searching/Retrieving data

**More Details**

Binary search trees are only performant when they are balanced. To have a balanced binary search tree is to have one which
all or most of the nodes have a left or right child so you have a full tree. In case you notice that you have one side much larger 
than the other the use of Linked List is advised.
