### data-structures

**Constant Time O(1)**
- Adding/Removing head nodes
- Adding/Removing tail nodes

**Linear Time O(n)**
- Searching through Linked List

**Memory Management Benefit**
Memory doesn't have to be stored together. Linked Lists are very effective at using space or memory efficiently. 
Each piece of data is stored on it's own and each piece of data has a next pointer that references the location 
of the next piece of data. All the data still connected it's just not stored all in one place.
